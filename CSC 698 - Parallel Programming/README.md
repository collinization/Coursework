The assignments in this class are intended for use with the Bridges Supercomputer at UC Berkely- without access to the Bridges server, the programs are useless. The goal of these programs is to increase the efficiency of algorithms when using the bridges server by parallelizng the algorithms effectively, thereby increasing the amount of processing power being used for the algorithms.
